# AutoComplete


1. trying to do a remote json request for data, then load through AC. (Index.html) is a remote call to my local server getting back 
JSON. KP-response.json shows the response. 
2. The Category feature is setup to work locally. (categories.html) I want to adjust this to use the remote data, 
The formatting is different though.

The original Remote data json was returned like this:
jQuery110209934040546324798_1446750731813(["Pleasant City, OH, United States","Pleasant Dale, NE, United States","Pleasant Garden, NC, United States","Pleasant Grove, AL, United States","Pleasant Grove, AR, United States","Pleasant Grove, CA, United States","Pleasant Grove, UT, United States","Pleasant Hall, PA, United States","Pleasant Hill, CA, United States","Pleasant Hill, IL, United States","Pleasant Hill, LA, United States","Pleasant Hill, MO, United States","Pleasant Hill, NC, United States","Pleasant Hill, OH, United States","Pleasant Hill, OR, United States","Pleasant Hill, TN, United States","Pleasant Hope, MO, United States","Pleasant Lake, IN, United States","Pleasant Lake, MI, United States","Pleasant Mills, IN, United States"]);


Do you think I should pursue combining these two to get this? Or go another route?
